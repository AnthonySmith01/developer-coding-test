# Full Stack Developer Coding Test

This repository contains a static JSON file, which represents the relationship between students and their "quest" (learning module) completions in myEd.

Your task is to build a basic front end that clearly displays students with their quests, completion data and marks, powered by an API back end on top of a database.

You must seed a database with the JSON data. You may use whatever database technology you'd like.

This project should take no more than 2 hours, but feel free to spend more time on it and be creative in your solution.

## The API

The API must implement the following endpoint:

* **GET** */route_name_here*
    - This endpoint returns the list of students with their quests and completion data for each quest.

## Getting Started
To get started, we recommend you start by setting up a HTTP backend that serves the data from the JSON file.

## Requirements

- Be creative in your solution
- Include any README notes or explanations
- We don't expect a polished application, but a project that focusses on showcasing your skills

## Suggestions
- Containerise part or all of the application in Docker
- Use a language you find interesting or have always wanted to try
- Focus on the area that most showcases your ability
